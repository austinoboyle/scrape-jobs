Once selected, we provide teachers with 3 weeks of preparation and 2 years of professional support. Successful candidates will start teaching in September 2018.\n\nWhy we exist:\n\nEducation in Canada is a success story, but high overall quality masks deep inequality. The twin challenges of teacher supply and turnover compound historical injustice and systemic inequities to produce an education gap between First Nations and non-First Nations communities.\n\nThe right kind of teacher can help fill this gap. We work with northern First Nations to recruit, prepare, and support committed teachers who will increase student outcomes in the north.\n\nMinimum Qualifications:\n\n\u2022 Certified or certification-eligible to teach in a Canadian province or territory\n\n\u2022 Legal working status in Canada for the minimum two-year teaching commitment\n\n\u2022 Available to attend the Summer Enrichment Program July 15 to August 3, 2018 (all-expenses covered by Teach For Canada)\n\n\u2022 Able to relocate and teach full-time in a rural First Nations community in northern Ontario\n\nWhat we look for:\n\nWhat does a successful northern educator look like? They overcome challenges with flexibility and bring community into their classroom. Outside of school, they get involved in the community, lead extracurricular activities, and explore the natural environment. But above all, they come humbly to learn as much as they teach.\n\nAs an organization that works with Indigenous communities, we value Indigenous perspectives in our program and encourage Indigenous candidates to apply.\n\n2018 Selection timeline:\n\n\u2022 Deadline: May 27\n\n\u2022 Introductory interviews: June 3-5\n\n\u2022 Fit interviews: June 8-10 \u2022 Reference checks: June 11-20\n\n\u2022 Offers Extended: June 22 Selected teachers are matched with communities from June 25-July 13, 2018.\n\nSelected teachers are matched with communities from June 25-July 13, 2018",

Once selected, we provide teachers with 3 weeks of preparation and 2 years of professional support. Successful candidates will start teaching in September 2018.\n\nWhy we exist:\n\nEducation in Canada is a success story, but high overall quality masks deep inequality. The twin challenges of teacher supply and turnover compound historical injustice and systemic inequities to produce an education gap between First Nations and non-First Nations communities.\n\nThe right kind of teacher can help fill this gap. We work with northern First Nations to recruit, prepare, and support committed teachers who will increase student outcomes in the north.\n\nMinimum Qualifications:\n\n\u2022 Certified or certification-eligible to teach in a Canadian province or territory\n\n\u2022 Legal working status in Canada for the minimum two-year teaching commitment\n\n\u2022 Available to attend the Summer Enrichment Program July 15 to August 3, 2018 (all-expenses covered by Teach For Canada)\n\n\u2022 Able to relocate and teach full-time in a rural First Nations community in northern Ontario\n\nWhat we look for:\n\nWhat does a successful northern educator look like? They overcome challenges with flexibility and bring community into their classroom. Outside of school, they get involved in the community, lead extracurricular activities, and explore the natural environment. But above all, they come humbly to learn as much as they teach.\n\nAs an organization that works with Indigenous communities, we value Indigenous perspectives in our program and encourage Indigenous candidates to apply.\n\n2018 Selection timeline:\n\n\u2022 Deadline: May 27\n\n\u2022 Introductory interviews: June 3-5\n\n\u2022 Fit interviews: June 8-10 \u2022 Reference checks: June 11-20\n\n\u2022 Offers Extended: June 22 Selected teachers are matched with communities from June 25-July 13, 2018.\n\nSelected teachers are matched with communities from June 25-July 13, 2018",
